# House Price Prediction
- Predict the sale price of the house using Linear Regression in R.
- House prices can be predicted using several variables, including Lot Area, Street, Neighborhood, Year Built, Number of rooms(bedroom, Kitchen, etc.). Etc.
- The process consists of four stages: Cleaning the data, Modeling the probability of sales price using a normal distribution, Exploratory Data Analysis, Preparing the Data for modelling, and Fitting the linear model.
- Linear Regression is a powerful tool for predicting the sale price and interpreting how the different features influence the target variable.
